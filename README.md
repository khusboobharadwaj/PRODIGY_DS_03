# Prodigy_DataScience_Task3
Introduction:
The goal of this project is to create a decision tree classifier to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product or service, specifically a term deposit, based on various features such as age, job, marital status, and previous marketing campaign outcomes. Decision trees are a popular machine learning technique due to their interpretability and simplicity.
Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the script to preprocess the data, train the decision tree model, and evaluate its performance.
Results:
The decision tree classifier will output performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Additionally, the tree structure will be visualized to understand the decision-making process.
